    "\n",
    "### 1. Get the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the notebooks from GitHub with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:widdowquinn/Teaching-Stan-Hierarchical-Modelling.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then change into the repository directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd Teaching-Stan-Hierarchical-Modelling/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create a `virtualenv` to run the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `virtualenv` we create a standalone Python virtual environment with the appropriate libraries installed. This will not interfere with system Python or any other Python instances available on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "virtualenv -p python3.6 venv-stan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv-stan/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, install the required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, install Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Starting the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "To start Jupyter, issue the following at the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should bring up a view on the current directory in your browser. Click on any of the `.ipynb` notebook files to start them running in your browser."
