    "By visual inspection, we can see that using unpooled county estimates for prevailing radon level has resulted in models that deviate from the pooled estimates, correcting for its *bias*. However, we can also see that for counties with few observations, the fitted estimates track the observations very closely, suggesting that there has been *overfitting*. The attempt to minimise error due to *bias* has resulted in the introduction of greater error due to *variance* in the dataset."
